## Motivation

Video games has served the purpose as a way to escape the real world and into an imaginary world where people can focus on something they truly enjoy. It has become something allows us to de-stress and have fun while playing. It has also allowed friends and strangers to interact or play with each other creating stronger bonds no matter where you are in the world. This is more evident especially during these times of quarantine where people cannot simply meet each other. These video games gave a platform to people to continue to interact with each other and enjoy everyones presence even if it is just online. Video games has also lead to thousands of jobs around the world from game developers, to professional e-sport atheletes, and to livestreamers. Video games has opened countless opportunities for people to experience.

Over the past few decades, video games have slowly taken over the world by storm. From the introduction of the first commercially successful video game "Pong" to the present day cloud gaming services. The gaming industry has been alive for only around 49 years but it has become one of the largest profitable markets in the world. According to the Visual Capitalist, in 2020, the gaming industry was estimated to have earned a revenue of $165 billion. Gaming has become the biggest entertainment market by beating markets like television, film box office, and digital music. Through innovation and constant increase in popularity, it is said that its revenue forecast will hit $291 billion by 2027. It has been a couple of years now that the gaming industry has dominated the world market and has become a more accepted aspect of life for a majority of people around the world.
